## Email sender
This project builds an email-sender which is able to send emails in command line in batch by using the following packages: 
- async
- chalk
- commander
- csv 
- dotenv
- inquirer 
- sendgrid

## How to use
Clone it to your local, run `npm i`, then run `broadcast -l input/recipients.csv`, where the recipients.csv stores your recipients name and email and you can customize it. The template information sits in `template.js`.
